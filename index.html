          Why donate to UNICEF? It's a smart way to make your money go further for children:
      </h4>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>   knows connectivity is power </strong> The Giga Initiative, UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union’s collaboration to connect every school to the internet, expanded to over 86,000 schools and more than 25.8 million students
              and teachers in 2020. UNICEF also signed agreements with mobile network operators in 94 countries to provide millions of learners free access to online educational content</li>
          <li><strong> UNICEF supports girls’ rights and their futures:   </strong>In 2020, UNICEF helped over 14 million girls enroll in early learning, primary or secondary education </li>
          <li><strong>   UNICEF supports teachers, too: </strong> UNICEF and Microsoft's Learning Passport was adapted to offer lessons in sign language, COVID-19–prevention teacher training and resources on gender equality, sexuality education and violence
              against women and girls
          </li>
          <li><strong>  UNICEF is bridging the digital divide:  </strong> Helping children feel prepared and empowered to learn is a big part of UNICEF’s work. Last year, 43.4 million children received learning materials </li>
          <li><strong>  UNICEF is bridging the digital divide: </strong> 2.8 million households benefited from cash assistance to meet families’ basic needs and relieve the economic pressures that can force children to go to work — not school </li>
          <li><strong> UNICEF levels the playing field:    </strong> knows connectivity is power </li>
          <li><strong>UNICEF prioritizes the education of children with disabilities:    </strong> Teacher training has helped make inclusive education a reality for children with disabilities in 54 percent of the countries where UNICEF works</li>
      </ul>

  Highlights
The Global Innovation Strategy guides everything we do to innovate with and for children.  

It ensures that all the investments we make in innovation fit with our global aim of ensuring that every child can survive, thrive, and live and learn in a safe, inclusive space.  

The strategy ensures that innovation is applied to the toughest, most pressing problems faced by some of the most vulnerable children and young people.  

We take a systematic approach to innovation, applying skills and energy across digital platforms, physical products, new ways of financing and new ways of working to boost impact and efficiency.  

Whilst moving quickly and taking calculated risks, we’re investing in rolling out proven, life-changing innovations to millions and creating a culture of innovation across the organization. 

And we're continuing to work with partners - and through our network of global problem solvers - to accelerate results for children worldwide.
