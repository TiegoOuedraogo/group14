            <h1>Child Protection</h1>
            <h3>Every child has the right to live free from violence, exploitation and abuse.</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Children worldwide suffer insidious forms of violence, exploitation and abuse.</p>
        <p>Violence against children knows no boundaries. It happens in every country, 
            and in the places children should be most protected – their homes, schools 
            and online. It can be physical, emotional or sexual. And in most cases, 
            children experience violence at the hands of the people they trust.</p>
        <p>Children in humanitarian settings are especially vulnerable. During 
            armed conflict, natural disasters and other emergencies, children may be 
            forced to flee their homes, some torn from their families and exposed to 
            exploitation and abuse along the way. They may be injured or killed by 
            explosive weapons in conflict, or recruited by armed forces. 
            Especially for girls and women, the threat of gender-based violence soars.</p>
        <p>Harmful cultural practices pose another grave risk to girls and boys worldwide.
            Hundreds of millions of girls have been subjected to child marriage and female 
            genital mutilation – even though both are internationally recognized human rights violations.</p>
        <p>No matter their story or circumstance, all children have the right to be protected from violence, 
            exploitation and abuse. Child protection systems help children access vital social services 
            and fair justice systems – starting at birth. They reach out to the most vulnerable children, 
            including those with disabilities; girls and boys who have been placed in alternative care; 
            children uprooted by conflict, poverty and disaster; or those who may become victims of child 
            labour or trafficking, or recruited into armed groups. Child protection systems prioritize 
            children’s physical, mental, and psychosocial needs to safeguard their lives and futures.</p>
