                    <h4>
                        Why donate to UNICEF? It's a smart way to make your
                        money go further for children:
                    </h4>
                    <p>Every child has the right to live free from violence,
                        exploitation and abuse.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Children worldwide suffer insidious forms of violence,
                    exploitation and abuse.</p>
                <p>Violence against children knows no boundaries. It happens in
                    every country,
                    and in the places children should be most protected – their
                    homes, schools
                    and online. It can be physical, emotional or sexual. And in
                    most cases,
                    children experience violence at the hands of the people they
                    trust.</p>
                <p>Children in humanitarian settings are especially vulnerable.
                    During
                    armed conflict, natural disasters and other emergencies,
                    children may be
                    forced to flee their homes, some torn from their families
                    and exposed to
                    exploitation and abuse along the way. They may be injured or
                    killed by
                    explosive weapons in conflict, or recruited by armed forces.
                    Especially for girls and women, the threat of gender-based
                    violence soars.</p>
                <p>Harmful cultural practices pose another grave risk to girls
                    and boys worldwide.
                    Hundreds of millions of girls have been subjected to child
                    marriage and female
                    genital mutilation – even though both are internationally
                    recognized human rights violations.</p>
                <p>No matter their story or circumstance, all children have the
                    right to be protected from violence,
                    exploitation and abuse. Child protection systems help
                    children access vital social services
                    and fair justice systems – starting at birth. They reach out
                    to the most vulnerable children,
                    including those with disabilities; girls and boys who have
                    been placed in alternative care;
                    children uprooted by conflict, poverty and disaster; or
                    those who may become victims of child
                    labour or trafficking, or recruited into armed groups. Child
                    protection systems prioritize
                    children’s physical, mental, and psychosocial needs to
                    safeguard their lives and futures.</p>
