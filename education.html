        <h3>
            In 2020, UNICEF’s education programs reached more children than ever. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF helped 301 million children continue their education via remote learning

        <h4>
            Kids need UNICEF now more than ever:
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Millions of children worldwide missed two-thirds of an academic year due to COVID-19-related school closures. In July 2021, 600 million children were still out of school
            </li>
            <li>Before the pandemic, roughly 230 million teens lacked the math and reading skills needed for jobs that could help lift them out of poverty. COVID-19's economic toll has created even more obstacles: longer school-to-work transitions, redundancy
                and lay-offs</li>
            <li>The vast majority of children with no way to learn are from the poorest families in lower-income countries’ rural areas</li>
            <li>An estimated 23.8 million children are expected to drop out of school permanently due to the pandemic</li>
            <li>When girls drop out of school, many are forced into child marriage. The pandemic could force 10 million more girls to marry by 2030</li>
            <li>At the height of the pandemic, COVID-19 school closures forced 1.6 billion schoolchildren to put their learning on hold. Despite world governments’ efforts to develop educational alternatives, one in three kids—463 million children—had no
                access to remote learning
            </li>
            <li>The number of children living below the poverty line could soar by as many as 117 million thanks to COVID-19, jeopardizing 700 million children’s futures
            </li>

        </ul>
