    <h1> Unicef</h1>
    <h3>
        In 2020, UNICEF’s education programs reached more children than ever. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF helped 301 million children continue their education via remote learning
    </h3>

    <h4>
        Kids need UNICEF now more than ever:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Millions of children worldwide missed two-thirds of an academic year due to COVID-19-related school closures. In July 2021, 600 million children were still out of school
        </li>
        <li>Before the pandemic, roughly 230 million teens lacked the math and reading skills needed for jobs that could help lift them out of poverty. COVID-19's economic toll has created even more obstacles: longer school-to-work transitions, redundancy
            and lay-offs</li>
        <li>The vast majority of children with no way to learn are from the poorest families in lower-income countries’ rural areas</li>
        <li>An estimated 23.8 million children are expected to drop out of school permanently due to the pandemic</li>
        <li>When girls drop out of school, many are forced into child marriage. The pandemic could force 10 million more girls to marry by 2030</li>
        <li>At the height of the pandemic, COVID-19 school closures forced 1.6 billion schoolchildren to put their learning on hold. Despite world governments’ efforts to develop educational alternatives, one in three kids—463 million children—had no access
            to remote learning
        </li>
        <li>The number of children living below the poverty line could soar by as many as 117 million thanks to COVID-19, jeopardizing 700 million children’s futures
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>
        Why donate to UNICEF? It's a smart way to make your money go further for children:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>   knows connectivity is power </strong> The Giga Initiative, UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union’s collaboration to connect every school to the internet, expanded to over 86,000 schools and more than 25.8 million students
            and teachers in 2020. UNICEF also signed agreements with mobile network operators in 94 countries to provide millions of learners free access to online educational content</li>
        <li><strong> UNICEF supports girls’ rights and their futures:   </strong>In 2020, UNICEF helped over 14 million girls enroll in early learning, primary or secondary education </li>
        <li><strong>   UNICEF supports teachers, too: </strong> UNICEF and Microsoft's Learning Passport was adapted to offer lessons in sign language, COVID-19–prevention teacher training and resources on gender equality, sexuality education and violence
            against women and girls
        </li>
        <li><strong>  UNICEF is bridging the digital divide:  </strong> Helping children feel prepared and empowered to learn is a big part of UNICEF’s work. Last year, 43.4 million children received learning materials </li>
        <li><strong>  UNICEF is bridging the digital divide: </strong> 2.8 million households benefited from cash assistance to meet families’ basic needs and relieve the economic pressures that can force children to go to work — not school </li>
        <li><strong> UNICEF levels the playing field:    </strong> knows connectivity is power </li>
        <li><strong>UNICEF prioritizes the education of children with disabilities:    </strong> Teacher training has helped make inclusive education a reality for children with disabilities in 54 percent of the countries where UNICEF works</li>


    </ul>
